# Air-Pollution-Monitoring-System

The idea is to develop a network which can help to rate the air pollution level of a particular place ,i.e, it is good, average or below average. 
This is just a demo code using random data. The actual data can be fetched by installing wireless sensor networks.
This is mainly the code for the backend as it was a group project and I was responsible to make the backend.

The technologies used are: Google Map APIs, php, javascript, xml and mysql.
